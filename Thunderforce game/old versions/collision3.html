    <h1>Collision detection exercise, Hannah Dee</h1>
    <h2>A steerable player box</h2>

    <p>This canvas has some boxes, and you have to write the "collides" function which determines when they overlap</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Study the code carefully.</li>
        <li>If there are things that don't make sense, just ask.</li>
        <li>Have a go at writing the collides function (there are some hints at the bottom). </li>
        <li>When you've done that, make the black blocks move: you can do this how you like, one thing you could try is to just change x or y during the game loop, and re-draw them somewhere else when they go off the screen.</li>
        <li>When you've done that, try to make something happen when there is a collision (delete a black block and make it appear somewhere new? have an explosion? a prize with bonus points? up to you).</li>
    </ol>
    <canvas id = "collisions_canv" width = "700" height = "300" style = "border:1px dotted" ></canvas>
